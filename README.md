# Project-1---Exercise-1.2-Enhancing-Your-Digital-CV-with-a-Table

## Project Title: Enhancing Your Digital CV with a Structured Tools Section

## Description
This project focuses on refining a digital curriculum vitae (CV) by integrating a new, professionally formatted "Tools" section. The primary objective is to showcase technical proficiencies in a clear, organized, and easily digestible table format, enhancing the overall readability and professional appeal of the CV. This exercise demonstrates foundational web development skills, specifically in structuring content with HTML and styling with CSS.

## Features
* **Structured Tools Section:** A dedicated section within the CV to list various software, platforms, and utilities.
* **Tabular Data Presentation:** Utilizes an HTML `<table>` element to present tools, their descriptions, and proficiency levels in an organized, readable format.
* **Improved Readability:** Enhances the user experience by providing a quick overview of technical competencies.
* **Responsive Design Principles:** Built with the intention of being adaptable to various screen sizes (though specific responsive CSS may need further refinement based on `style.css`).
* **Integration with Existing CV Structure:** Seamlessly adds the new section into an existing HTML CV layout.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For structuring the content and creating the table.
* **CSS3:** For styling the CV, including the new table, to ensure a clean and professional appearance.
* **Chart.js (Existing):** For the interactive skills pie chart.
